# atom-ide-ui

A collection of Atom UIs to support language services (namely the LSP).

This repository holds the published Atom package, which is a thin wrapper over the [`atom-ide-ui` NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atom-ide-ui).

The code for `atom-ide-ui` can be found at https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/modules/atom-ide-ui.
To contribute, please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/modules/atom-ide-ui/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> NOTE: Unfortunately `apm publish` behaves quite differently from NPM, which makes it difficult to maintain both an APM-friendly repository and an NPM-friendly repository. This is our workaround!

## Requirements

`atom-ide-ui` requires Atom 1.17+.

Packages based on https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient should work out of the box with `atom-ide-ui` installed.
